Project Overview

What We're Building:
Build an inventory management system for a fashion warehouse with multi-location distribution.

Key Innovation: 
Unlike basic inventory systems, Attire Flow implements role-based inventory control with:
Transfer workflows (PENDING → APPROVED → COMPLETED)
Reorder-level alerts for low stock
Supplier-linked products for purchase tracking
Audit trails via Transfer logs


How It Works:
Admin creates Brands, Products, Warehouses, and Suppliers in the system.
Variants (size/color combos) are linked to Products -  each with its own SKU and price.
Inventory is tracked per Variant per Warehouse, with reorder-level alerts.

Managers can:
View stock levels
Restock inventory when low

Admins oversee everything:
Approve/audit Transfers
Manage Suppliers and Users
Maintain product catalogs

The system ensures data integrity through role-based access , no customer-facing storefront through:
Role-based access control
Low-stock notifications

Note: There is no customer-facing storefront - this is strictly an internal warehouse management tool. Inventory is managed at fixed warehouse locations with no transfers between them.
