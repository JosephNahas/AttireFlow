Project Overview:

Attire Flow is a robust, full-stack inventory management system designed for multi-location clothing distribution networks. Managing clothing logistics requires precision, especially when handling various brands and shifting stock between regional distribution centers.

This application provides a centralized dashboard for administrators to monitor stock health, manage product catalogs, and orchestrate inventory transfers to prevent stockouts and overstocking.

Core Features:

Centralized Dashboard: Real-time visualization of total inventory value and stock distribution across all locations.

Multi-Location Management: Track inventory specifically by Distribution Center.

Product & Brand Catalog: Full CRUD operations for items and their respective brands.

Inventory Transfers: Move stock between locations with automated balance updates.

Low Stock Alerts: Visual indicators and notifications when items fall below a defined threshold.

Admin Authentication: Secure access for warehouse managers and staff.
